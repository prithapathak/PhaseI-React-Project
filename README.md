To create a movie app that lets users browse and search movies by genre, rating, or title

You have been given the task of developing a movie app as a React developer. The goal of this project is to create an application that is simple to use and allows users to search for films by title, rating, and genre. The app should incorporate various key concepts and features of React, including functional components, hooks, props, event handling, conditional rendering, and lists. To achieve this, the app should utilize the useState hook to effectively manage the state of the movie data. Additionally, it should utilize the Axios library to make API calls and fetch movie data from a movie API. The app should handle API response errors gracefully and provide appropriate error messages to the user. Furthermore, it should display a loading indicator while fetching data to enhance the user experience.
